The "Don't Worry, I'm Fine" film is a very personal project. When I started making films I knew this film was something I must do. Finding men who've had the shared experience of recovering from childhood sexual trauma has been a healing journey. 
The fact that Ending up with a film that might find the eyes of men who think they're the only ones who live with this pain, 
is a great side effect of this amazing experience. 

I can't believe we've been working on the film now for over three years. Luckily, we can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. We're working on our marketing plan to help get the film available in the best place for viewing. 

The editing is going really well at this point. We've finally honed the story we want to tell, and now it's on to the spit and polish to make it into an actual film. We're still planning on doing test screenings with an eye at submitting for film festivals in the fall. We hope the film will be available to the general public by summer of 2023 (though I'm a little optimistic).
