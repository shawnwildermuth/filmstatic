As I've worked on "Don't Worry, I'm Fine", I found a ton of great resources for men and women who are dealing with childhood sexual abuse. Not every resource is for everyone, but I thought I'd list some of the organizations that I admire:

- [1 in 6](http://www.1in6.org/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx)
This website has a 24 hour chat line to help survivors in crisis as well as a weekly group chat that can be very helpful. The website name comes from the statistic: "At least 1 in 6 men have been sexually abused or assaulted". 

- [Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN)](http://www.rainn.org/)
Not specific to men, but a great organization that is doing the hard work of helping people get the help they deserve.

- [Men Healing](https://menhealing.org)
This one of the first sites I found. They have a community forum that was helpful to see that I was not alone.

- [Survivor Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP)](https://www.snapnetwork.org/)
SNAP is a powerful organization that helps people who were abused by the clergy. Their groups are open to abuse victims, even if clergy weren't at fault.

- [The Bristlecone Project](http://bristleconeproject.org/)
An effort to record many men's stories of recovery from childhood sexual abuse. These are powerful stories that helped me see myself in others.

There are so many more I could list. For a more comprehensive list, Mike Lew (author of Victims No Longer) has a great list: https://nextstepcounseling.org/organizations
