We've been working really hard on the newest film, but we've finally decided on a final 
name for the film. Instead of "Don't Worry, I'm Fine", we're pivoting to the new name:

### Man Enough to Heal

We feel that this new name is more in line with what the film has to say. I'd love your feedback on the name. Feel free to email me at [Twain Films](mailto:shawn@twainfilms?subject=Man%20Enough) with your feedback!
